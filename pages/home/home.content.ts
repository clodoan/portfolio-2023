      "Originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina, I have a passion for soccer, enjoying a hearty Argentinian 'asado', and hitting the slopes for snowboarding. \n With experience as a founder in multiple venture-backed startups and as a design manager, I've transitioned my focus to hands-on design & technical work. \n I deeply value every aspect of the product journey, from identifying product requirements to honing prototypes and coding. The true alchemy occurs at the nexus of engineering and design. Viewing design as a perpetual evolution, I relish the act of crafting tangible creations with my own hands and sharing them with the world.",
